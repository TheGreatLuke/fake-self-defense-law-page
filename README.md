# Hidden Proxy Gate w/ TN Self Defense
Vibe coded because I don't know programming 

Basic proxygate utilizing a tn self defense page that, with proper authentication, will open a resources tab with multiple "research tools." Designed to evade basic detection.

Not designed to be secure or evade someone manually inspecting the code (though, does block right click); only evade basic detectors.
