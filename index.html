            <h2 id="overview">Overview of Tennessee Self-Defense Law</h2>
            
            <p>Tennessee law provides robust protections for individuals who use force to defend themselves, others, or their property. The state has codified both "Stand Your Ground" and "Castle Doctrine" principles, which eliminate the duty to retreat before using force in certain circumstances.</p>
            
            <p>Tennessee's self-defense laws are primarily found in Tennessee Code Annotated (TCA) Title 39, Chapter 11, Part 6. These statutes establish when the use of force, including deadly force, is legally justified.</p>
            
            <div class="statute-box">
                <div class="statute-ref">TCA § 39-11-611 - Self-Defense</div>
                A person is justified in threatening or using force against another person when and to the degree the person reasonably believes the force is immediately necessary to protect against the other's use or attempted use of unlawful force.
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="stand-your-ground">Stand Your Ground Provisions</h2>
            
            <p>Tennessee enacted its Stand Your Ground law in 2007, eliminating the common law duty to retreat before using defensive force. This means that if you are in a place where you have a legal right to be, you are not required to attempt to flee before defending yourself.</p>
            
            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>Key Requirements for Stand Your Ground</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You must be in a place where you have a legal right to be</li>
                    <li>You must not be engaged in illegal activity</li>
                    <li>You must have a reasonable belief that force is necessary</li>
                    <li>The threat must be immediate and unlawful</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Application in Public Spaces</h3>
            
            <p>The Stand Your Ground law applies in any location where you have a lawful right to be present, including public streets, parks, restaurants, stores, and your workplace. You do not have a duty to retreat from these locations if faced with a threat of unlawful force.</p>
            
            <div class="statute-box">
                <div class="statute-ref">TCA § 39-11-611(b)(2)</div>
                Any person using force intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury within a residence, business, dwelling or vehicle is presumed to have held a reasonable belief of imminent death or serious bodily injury to self, family, a member of the household or a person visiting as an invited guest, when that force is used against another person who unlawfully and forcibly enters...
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="castle-doctrine">Castle Doctrine</h2>
            
            <p>Tennessee's Castle Doctrine creates a legal presumption that a person who unlawfully and forcibly enters your home, vehicle, or business poses an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm. This presumption significantly strengthens your legal position if you use force against an intruder.</p>
            
            <h3>Protected Locations Under Castle Doctrine</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Residence:</strong> Your primary dwelling, including attached structures like garages</li>
                <li><strong>Dwelling:</strong> Any building or structure where you regularly stay, even temporarily</li>
                <li><strong>Vehicle:</strong> Any motor vehicle you lawfully occupy</li>
                <li><strong>Business:</strong> Commercial property you own or operate</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>The Presumption of Reasonable Fear</h3>
            
            <p>When someone unlawfully and forcibly enters one of these protected spaces, Tennessee law presumes you reasonably feared imminent death or serious bodily injury. This presumption can only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence to the contrary.</p>
            
            <h2 id="reasonable-force">What Constitutes Reasonable Force</h2>
            
            <p>The key standard in Tennessee self-defense law is "reasonableness." The force you use must be reasonable under the circumstances as you perceive them at the time of the incident.</p>
            
            <h3>Non-Deadly Force</h3>
            
            <p>Non-deadly force is justified when you reasonably believe it is immediately necessary to protect yourself or another person from the imminent use of unlawful force. The force used must be proportional to the threat faced.</p>
            
            <h3>Deadly Force</h3>
            
            <p>Deadly force is force that is intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury. Tennessee law permits the use of deadly force in specific circumstances:</p>
            
            <div class="statute-box">
                <div class="statute-ref">TCA § 39-11-611(b)(1)</div>
                Notwithstanding § 39-17-1322, a person who is not engaged in unlawful activity and is in a place where the person has a right to be has no duty to retreat before threatening or using force intended or likely to cause death or serious bodily injury, if the person has a reasonable belief that there is an imminent danger of death or serious bodily injury.
            </div>
            
            <ul>
                <li>To prevent imminent death or serious bodily injury to yourself or another person</li>
                <li>To prevent the commission of a forcible felony (such as aggravated robbery, rape, or kidnapping)</li>
                <li>Against an unlawful and forcible entry into your home, vehicle, or business</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h2 id="immunity">Civil and Criminal Immunity</h2>
            
            <p>Tennessee law provides both criminal and civil immunity for individuals who lawfully use force in self-defense. This is a significant protection that goes beyond simply having a valid legal defense.</p>

                <h3>Criminal Immunity</h3>
                <p>If your use of force is justified under Tennessee law, you cannot be prosecuted for assault, battery, or related offenses arising from that use of force.</p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="key-point">
                <h3>Civil Immunity</h3>
                <p>Tennessee Code § 39-11-622 provides immunity from civil liability for the lawful use of force in self-defense. This means that an attacker or their family generally cannot sue you for injuries sustained when you lawfully defended yourself.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h2 id="limitations">Limitations and Exceptions</h2>
            
            <p>While Tennessee's self-defense laws are protective of those who defend themselves, there are important limitations and circumstances where these protections do not apply.</p>
            
            <h3>When Self-Defense Does NOT Apply</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Initial Aggressor:</strong> If you provoked or initiated the confrontation, you generally cannot claim self-defense unless you clearly withdrew from the encounter</li>
                <li><strong>Illegal Activity:</strong> If you were engaged in illegal activity at the time, Stand Your Ground protections may not apply</li>
                <li><strong>Excessive Force:</strong> The force used must be proportional to the threat; you cannot use deadly force against a minor threat</li>
                <li><strong>Lawful Actions:</strong> You cannot use force against someone performing lawful actions, such as a police officer making a lawful arrest</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Defense of Property</h3>
            
            <p>Tennessee law allows the use of non-deadly force to protect property. However, deadly force is generally not justified solely to protect property, except in cases involving habitation (home, dwelling, vehicle) where the Castle Doctrine applies.</p>
            
            <div class="statute-box">
                <div class="statute-ref">TCA § 39-11-614 - Protection of Property</div>
                A person in lawful possession of real or personal property is justified in threatening or using force against another when and to the degree it is reasonably believed the force is immediately necessary to prevent or terminate the other's trespass on the land or unlawful interference with the property.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Duty to Retreat in Specific Circumstances</h3>
            
            <p>While Tennessee has eliminated the general duty to retreat, there may still be situations where attempting to safely retreat could affect the "reasonableness" analysis of your actions. Courts may consider whether retreat was safely possible when evaluating whether your belief in the necessity of force was reasonable.</p>
            
            <h2>Important Considerations</h2>
            
            <h3>Burden of Proof</h3>
            
            <p>In Tennessee, once you raise self-defense as a claim, the prosecution bears the burden of disproving self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt. You do not have to prove you acted in self-defense; rather, the state must prove you did not.</p>
            
            <h3>Immediate Aftermath</h3>
            
            <p>If you use force in self-defense, it is crucial to:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>Call 911 immediately and report the incident</li>
                <li>Request medical attention if needed</li>
                <li>Provide basic information to law enforcement but consider requesting an attorney before giving a detailed statement</li>
                <li>Preserve evidence and identify witnesses</li>
                <li>Contact a qualified criminal defense attorney as soon as possible</li>
            </ul>
